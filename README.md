# Exercise Project - Social Media App

The purpose of this small project is to practise and exercise my React skills.

The project itself comes from `the React Bootcamp` promoted by [freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-to-learn-react-in-2023/).

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
